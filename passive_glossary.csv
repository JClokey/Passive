POCIS,"Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler. A passive sampler consisting of a 'membrane-sorbent-membrane sandwich' designed for the detection of hydrophilic organic compounds (LogP <3.0). Compression rings seal a sorbent phase between two microporous polyethersulfone membranes which act as a semi-permeable diffusive membrane, allowing  diffusion of analytes while preventing the transfer of larger particles, molecules or microbiota.",POCIS,"Two compression rings (metallic or polymeric) with necessary screws and nuts, two membrane disks (microporous polyethersulfone), sorbent layer (",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
