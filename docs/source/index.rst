Welcome to Passive's documentation
==================================

**Passive** is intended as a toolbox for the aquatic passive sampling community.
It aims to make the various calculations required for passive sampling **accessible, understandable and reproducible.**
Currently passive sampling literature is disparate and contained within subscription journals.
Discussions during the international passive sampling workshop 2022 in Utrecht, NL, showed that many practitioners were reinventing the wheel and using disparate methods for calculation.
There was general consensus that one of the obstacles to greater uptake of passive sampling in both research and wider water monitoring campaigns was the lack of easy, functional calculators.

### Calculators
To address this the Passive python library will provide standardised calculations for a variety of passive sampler configurations including:
 - Sampling rate (R<sub>s</sub>) calculation
 - Time-weighted average calculation
 - Various K<sub>sw</sub> calculations
 - Kinetic - curvilinear - equilibrium fits and comparisons
 - Half-time to equilibrium calculations
 - Publication quality graphs

### Learn
Additionally a module titled **learn** will provide various functions explaining and demonstrating passive sampling concepts such as:
 - Kinetic vs curvilinear vs equilibrium sampling
 - Different types of passive samplers
 - Limitations of passive sampling
 - Standard operating procedures for construction, deployment and extraction
 - Quality assurance and quality control
