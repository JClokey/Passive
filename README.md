# Passive
**Passive** is intended as a toolbox for the aquatic passive sampling community.<br/>
It aims to make the various calculations required for passive sampling **accessible, understandable and reproducible.**<br/>
Currently passive sampling literature is disparate and contained within subscription journals.<br/>
Discussions during the international passive sampling workshop 2022 in Utrecht, NL, showed that many practitioners were reinventing the wheel and using disparate methods for calculation.<br/>
There was general consensus that one of the obstacles to greater uptake of passive sampling in both research and wider water monitoring campaigns was the lack of easy, functional calculators.<br/>

### Calculators
To address this the Passive python library will provide standardised calculations for a variety of passive sampler configurations including:
 - Sampling rate (R~s~) calculation
 - Time-weighted average calculation
 - Various K~sw~ calculations
 - Kinetic - curvilinear - equilibrium fits and comparisons
 - Half-time to equilibrium calculations
 - Publication quality graphs

### Learn
Additionally a module titled **learn** will provide various functions explaining and demonstrating passive sampling concepts such as:
 - Kinetic vs curvilinear vs equilibrium sampling
 - Different types of passive samplers
 - Limitations of passive sampling
 - Standard operating procedures for construction, deployment and extraction
 - Quality assurance and quality control
